## Hello!

Hello! Welcome to my github. You will see some unfinished side projects/hobby stuff/course work here from time to time. I'm Heidi, doing and always learning some software engineering. Formerly I was doing physiology related things like imaging cells and analysing those results. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying for Azure/AWS certs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently growing python skills.
